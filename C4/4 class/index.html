from other elements on the page. Its value should start with a letter or an underscore (not a

have the same value for their id attributes (otherwise the value is no longer unique). -->

<!-- <iframe> :An iframe is like a little window that has been cut into your page — and in that
 window you can see another page. The term iframe is an abbreviation of inline
frame.One common use of iframes (that you may have seen on various websites) is to embed
a Google Map into a page. The content of the iframe can be any html page (either located on the
same server or anywhere else on the web).An iframe is created using the <iframe> element. There are a
few attributes that you will need to know to use it:

src:The src attribute specifies the URL of the page to show in the frame.

height:The height attribute specifies the height of the iframe in pixels.

width:The width attribute specifies the width of the iframe in pixels 

seamless:In HTML5, a new attribute called seamless can be applied to an iframe where scrollbars
are not desired. The seamless attribute (like some other new HTML5 attributes) does not
need a value, but you will often see authors give it a value of seamless. Older browsers
do not support the seamless  attribute. -->
